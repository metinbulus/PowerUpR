Description: 
 Includes tools to calculate statistical power, minimum detectable effect size (MDES), MDES difference (MDESD), and minimum required sample size for various multilevel randomized experiments with continuous outcomes.
 Some of the functions can assist with planning multilevel randomized experiments sensetive to detect multilevel moderation (2-1-1, 2-1-2, 2-2-1, and 2-2-2 designs) and multilevel mediation (2-1-1, 2-2-1, 3-1-1, 3-2-1, and 3-3-1 designs).
